//Class: Employee, Faculty, MyDate, Person, Staff, Student

/*
(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14
to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title.
Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test pro- gram that creates a Person, Student, Employee,
Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
